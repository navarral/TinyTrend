				<p>Hi! I'm <b>Albert</b> a postdoctoral researcher in the maternal and child health group at the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/">Human Technopole</a> (Milan, Italy). I work on how environmental factors affect the health of mothers and children.</p>
				
				<p>Welcome to TinyTrend! This research project aims to identify new environmental causes of premature birth by integrating text mining with epidemiological analyses. The project will combine population-wide health data from Lombardy, Italy, comprising 1 million pregnancies between 2012-2023, with insights derived from AI about changes in environmental policies in the same period. This work is funded by the European Union under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) postdoctoral fellowship program (ID: <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101153708">101153708</a>).</p>

				<h1>Researchers’ Night 2026 in Milan</h3>
				<div class="image-container">

					<p>The last Friday of September is always an exciting date on my calendar: Researchers’ Night. Researchers across the world bring their science outside the lab into the streets, museums, and universities. For me, it’s about sharing what we do and our passion for science to the people that could benefit the most. 
					<br>
					<br>
					On 26 September 2025, this special night was celebrated all across <a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/msca-citizens/join-a-celebration-of-science">Europe</a>. More than 1.5 million people took part in activities spread across 460 cities in 25 countries. From experiments and hands-on games to lively discussions and exhibitions, it was a chance for people of all ages to dive into the world of science and connect directly with researchers in their communities.</p>
						
				</div>
					<span class="dots"></span>
					<span class="more-text">
					
					<p>This was my second time joining Researchers’ Night in <a href="https://www.coscience.eu/English_info.html">Milan</a> after my first experience in 2025, but this year felt different. For the first time, I was going to showcase the project I’m working on as part of my MSCA postdoctoral fellowship. My research is about figuring out what environmental factors might cause babies to be born too early, before 37 weeks instead of the full-term 40. What made it feel especially personal was that I’m using data from all pregnant women living in Lombardia. In a way, I was meeting people at the event who, until now, only existed in my dataset as numbers. Even though our dataset is fully anonymised, standing there and talking to people who might one day benefit from my work was both nerve-wracking and incredibly exciting. It made me feel the real impact my research could have.</p>
					
					<p>In past editions, I had developed interactive games that people could play on their phones by scanning a QR code. This time, though, I wanted to create something hands-on that families could play together. It was time for some brainstorming with the young researchers from the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/en/research-groups/zuccolo-group/">Zuccolo group</a>.</p>
								
					<p>We sat down with Valeria and Alice and started listing concepts from my project alonside games we loved playing as kids (and maybe still enjoy now). Eventually, we settled on a Memory game, where players try to find matching pairs of cards, flipping only two cards at a time. The idea was to draw concepts from the project on the cards so we could explain them to participants as they played, and leave room to improvise or adapt the game depending on the players’ age.</p>
					
					<p>However, our first attempt at a vertical poster for the game didn’t go as planned. We had used velkro to attach the cards but flippling one often pulled the whole poster down, definitely not kid-friendly. Then, Lucia suggested using wooden clothespins, and it worked like a charm. I also want to thank the Human Technopole communication team for suggesting a fabric poster, it not only looked good but could also be reused for future events. With that, we were ready for the night.</p>
					
					<p>Running the activity throughout the evening was a learning experience in itself. alking to children and families was easy and fun, while discussing the project with curious university professors could be more challenging, especially when they came with preconceptions. We found the game worked best when we shortened it slightly, uncovering some cards to keep the pace lively. What impressed me most was how genuinely interested people were, teenagers included! Many not only played along but also contributed thoughtful ideas. We even gave participants the chance to draw their own cards, creating new concepts for us to explore.</p>
					
					<p>I also want to give a big thank you to Laura and Giulia, who stepped in at the last minute to help me run the game. Having them there made the whole activity much smoother and, honestly, way more fun. As you can see, so many people contributed to this event, and it really reminded me how much collaboration and shared energy can bring a project to life.</p>
					
					<p>For me, the whole evening was more than just outreach. It was also a reminder of why I love being a researcher. Walking around and seeing so many projects about water quality, forensics, wool, chessnuts, nuclear fusion, migratory birds, light, microscopes and many more; meeting other passionate researchers, and sharing ideas left me feeling recharged and inspired. It was like plugging back into the energy that keeps science alive.</p>
					
					<p>I have also come away convinced that this memory-game format could be adapted to almost any scientific project. It’s simple, interactive and fun, perfect for bringing abstract concepts to life. So if you’re a fellow researcher looking for a way to engage the public, feel free to borrow the idea!</p>

					<h1>Research at the Human Technopole in Milan (Italy)</h3>
					
						<p>I first heard about the Fondazione Human Technopole (HT) when I was looking for options after the end of my PhD. At the time, I was reading books on careers options after a doctoral degree as I was unsure on whether I wanted to remain in academia, move to industry, non-profits, or teaching jobs. Even though I tried to prepare myself for a change, the only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to continue to do research.</p>

								style="border-radius: 6%; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: 1em; max-height: 20vh" >
					
						<br>
						<br>
						I started to browse the job market in Europe for postdoc calls, scientist and data scientist openings, and several word combinations of job titles that were in at least some way related to research. It was not easy at the start, but after some time, I found an opening posted on <a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/">EURAXESS</a> about a postdoc on Health Data Science in Milan (Italy). They were looking for someone with experience in linking health and environmental data to enable research on maternal and child health. The first thought that crossed my mind after reading the description was “They are talking about me!”. I dug deeper into what the research group, centre and environment were like, and I saw myself working there.</p>
							
						<p>While I was drawn to the group’s vision for child and maternal health, I still had to consider whether HT was the right fit for me. I had already left my beloved Barcelona to pursue a PhD in Dublin, and the idea of taking another leap was not easy as this time. This job meant being in a country known for less favourable research contracts compared to the rest of Europe. I reached out to some Italian friends and colleagues to get a better sense of HT’s reputation. They had all heard about the institute (this was 2022). Yet, none of my Spanish or Irish friends had heard of it. HT had been making headlines in Italy for years as the country’s largest research investment. Friends (and friends-of-friends) reassured me that if I wanted to do research in Italy, HT was definitely my best bet.</p>
						
						<p>Unlike other research centres and universities where most researchers were Italian, HT had a more international environment – 40% of its researchers came from abroad, half of them were Italians coming back after study or work in foreign institutions. On top of that, they offered four-year contracts (now extended to five years), which was unheard of for postdocs in Dublin or Barcelona. The salary was competitive, and under a new Italian law designed to attract research talent, 90% of my earnings would be <a href="https://www.itaxa.it/blog/rientro-dei-cervelli/">tax-exempt</a>.</p>
									
						<p>So far, I had considered the research motivation and economic aspects, but what if the institute had a narrow, discipline-specific focus approach to science? I wanted to develop my interdisciplinary profile by tackling complex problems from multiple angles. Fortunately, HT takes a global and interdisciplinary approach to the study of human biology, integrating experimental and computational research. The institude brings together researchers from genomics, neurogenomics, structural biology, computational biology, health data science, molecular cell biology and biophysical modelling and simulation to study fundamental mechanisms of biological systems relevant to human diseases.</p>
						
						<p>This was the collaborative environment I was looking for, where different fields intersect to push scientific boundaries. I am glad I decided to join Human Technopole in June 2023. Since then, I got the opportunity to attend both internal and external weekly seminar on topics beyond my expertise, broadening my perspective on research in unexpected ways. I also appreciate being part of a diverse postdoc community that promotes interdisciplinary approaches. Overall, I would encourage PhD students looking for postdoc positions to thoroughly research the group and institute to make sure their scientific goals and contract terms are a good fit.</p>

					<h1>Tips for winning a MSCA postdoctoral fellowship</h3>
					
						<p>The application process was intense and challenging. I arrived at Human Technopole last June 2023 just after defending my PhD thesis in Trinity College Dublin, and I needed a proposal ready for September. I faced the challenge of crafting my first proposal for a postdoctoral grant. </p>
							
						<span class="dots"></span>
						<span class="more-text">
						<img src="assets/figure_post2.png" alt="MSCA-Logo" 
								style="border-radius: 8%; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: 1em; max-height: 20vh" >
								
						<p>We had no previous successful applications in the research center and I did not personally know anyone that had won an MSCA (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions) postdoctoral fellowship. I started by asking previous winners for guidance based on their published abstracts from the EU portal (Tip #1). I was surprised by how many replies I got, and I was soon meeting with a dozen of them, some of which kindly shared their winning proposals with me. This was a tipping point as it helped me understand the importance of structure, content balance, and importance of interdisciplinarity for this type of grant (Tip #2). They also emphasised that a key aspect of the proposal is to show that you are exactly the right person for the specific project based on your expertise, institution/research group that you will be working on, and the training that you could access to advance your future career (Tip #3). At that point, I was ready to start writing this proposal. However, the situation suddenly changed.</p>
						
						<p>I was forced to change my initial idea for the project after a couple months working on it. I realised that the environmental data I wanted to use was lacking a key temporal characteristic. Learning from this, I believe conducting preliminary analyses early on is fundamental to understand the feasibility of an idea (Tip #4), as well as, seeking input from others early in the process (Tip #5). </p>
						
						<p>In the following days, I presented a new project idea to both my supervisor (Dr. Luisa Zuccolo) and the Health data Science centre’s project manager (Dr. Giulia Mangiameli), and we agreed that it was worth the try despite the time constrains. The second round of proposal writing was easier despite still being stressful and challenging. We worked together with Luisa complementing each other’s skills and disciplinary background to craft this interdisciplinary project that combines data science, environmental science, perinatal epidemiology, and public health. After feedback a feedback session with my collegues the proposal was ready for submission (Tip #6).</p>

						</p>
						
						<p>Writing a MSCA postdoctoral fellowship is a challenging and exhausting task, but also a priceless training for any future grant application. Indeed, I think that applying for this kind of fellowships is the best way to start a postdoc position after your PhD, even if you do not succeed, because it makes you get in touch with knowledge and concepts that may be necessary in your new position, catch up with the state-of-the-art in your field, and, most importantly, conceptualize and design the objectives and methodology of your research project for the following years.</p>
						
						<p>My advice is to focus on the soundness of your research project before anything else: be sure to have clear and consistent objectives, to understand them, and provide a detailed methodology that proves how feasible they are. If you can, look for advice from MSCA alumni you have contact with, and carefully read and follow the suggestions from the handbook provided by the MSCA-NET. Finally, and speaking from my experience, if you fail in your first attempt, and you have the chance to reapply the following year, do not give up, use all what you learnt and the feedback from the evaluators, and try again: the chances are much higher in a second round.</p>

					<h1>Journey from Nanotechnology to Health Data Science</h1>
					
					
						
						<p>A researcher working with health data needs to gather, analyse and link information about people and their health to help improve healthcare and make it better for everyone. These tasks require a combination of Maths, Statistics, technology and knowledge about the health domain to manage the very large amounts of different health datasets with pieces of information about our health.
						<br>
						<br>
						In this blog, I'll touch briefly on some key chapters of my journey. If any part of my story resonates with you, let me know as I’d be happy to expand on it in a full blog post if it would be helpful!</p>

					<h2>Chapter 1: Nanotechnology</h2>
					
					<p>Fresh out of school, I wanted to study life sciences in University but I was unsure of which one to choose. I was a good student in school but not an excellent one, which made difficult getting into medicine in Barcelona. When trying to select the next best option, I stumbled upon Nanotechnology (what a cool name I thought!). Nanotechnology involves studying and manipulating materials at the nanoscale, combining my favourite subjects of physics, chemistry, biology, and math to create advanced technologies in various fields. I ended up enjoying this degree, and I would do it again in a heartbeat, for both the degree and the people I met along the way.</p>
					
					<p>The most valuable takeaway from this degree was learning to solve complex problems within interdisciplinary teams. I gained the ability to understand colleagues from diverse backgrounds, even without mastering a single discipline – just their interactions. However, I felt I lacked experience in optimizing parameters, making data-driven decisions, and working with large datasets to model outcomes.</p>
					<!--</div>-->
					<h2>Chapter 2: Data modelling</h2>
					
					<p>I decided to take a couple of classes on environmental modelling during my Erasmus in Ghent to overcome my lack of data modelling skills and … I loved it! We were able to simplify a system and even do some predictions at the click of a button. No need to process 100 samples to find a good enough reagent while wearing a lab coat or these funny plastic gloves. I was in for a treat. I rapidly start catching up with coding in R and enrolled in data modelling master’s also in Barcelona. I was the only one from Nanotechnology that had chosen this route as most of my friends decided to do material sciences, biomedicine, biotechnology or take a gap year.</p>
					
					<p>During my master’s thesis, I had the chance to work with one of the top Climate and Health teams at ISGlobal in Barcelona. My supervisors, Xavier Rodó and Silvia Borràs, were incredibly passionate about research, and the enthusiasm was contagious. We investigated whether the composition of air masses could be linked to a rise in Kawasaki Disease cases in Japan. That’s when it clicked – I knew I wanted to do everything I could to pursue a career in research.</p>
					
					<h2>Chapter 3: Computer Science</h2>
					
					<p>When I first applied for a PhD position in Dublin through the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN), I wasn’t sure what to expect. The first interview didn’t go well as I struggled with the statistical questions, and nerves got the best of me. I left feeling disappointed, convinced I had missed my chance. But then something unexpected happened. One of the interviewers, Declan O’Sullivan, saw potential in me and suggested I apply for another position in Dublin. This position was in health data linkage using Semantic Web technologies, a field I knew nothing about.</p>
					
					<p>People always say that choosing the right PhD supervisor is just as important as choosing the topic itself. I knew he was one of the good ones after having a Skype chat together. This was one of the best decisions I ever made!</p>
					
					<p>The ITN provided me the opportunity to work with leading research teams in the health domain: epidemiology (Climate and Health group in ISGlobal Barcelona), rare disease research (Rare Kidney Disease group in Trinity College Dublin), health data governance (European Institute for Innovation through Health Data in Belgium), health data linkage (ADAPT centre in Trinity College Dublin). Even though COVID forced us to work remotely for most of my PhD, I still enjoyed being part of a network of PhD researchers, each tackling vasculitis from a different discipline or perspective.</p>
					
					<h2>Chapter 4: Health Data Science</h2>
					
					<p>After my PhD, I joined the Human Technopole in Milan (Italy) as a postdoc, working on child and maternal health with Luisa Zuccolo’s group. In the next posts, I’ll share more about this chapter, including how I went on to secure a MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship within a few months of joining in. </p>
